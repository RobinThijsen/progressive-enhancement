			<h4>The story</h4>
			<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <i>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</i> The farmer said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</i> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>
			<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <i>“Oh dear, that’s too <i class="bad">bad</i>,”</i> and the farmer responded, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i>“Isn’t that great!”</i> Again, he said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></p>
			<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <i class="good">good</i> or <i class="bad">bad</i> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <i class="good">good</i> fortune.</p>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p><i class="good">Good</i> and <i class="bad">Bad</i> are just one perspective. Bananas are <i class="good">good</i> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <i class="good">good</i> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
